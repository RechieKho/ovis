# Decisions superseded by the phrase pivot

Archived from docs/state.md → "Decisions made with the project owner" on 2026-10-18 (dream at `c043cee`).

These shaped the paragraph pipeline (English → model → Ovis Core), replaced by the phrase grammar (Plan 5). Some still hold in other words (the lockfile, the endpoint backend, `/` as real division).

| When | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Session 1 | English → small LLM → strict IR (Ovis Core) → LLVM. The model never writes IR. |
| Session 1 | The lockfile caches translations for reproducible, offline builds. |
| Plan 1 | Built-in model weights: lookup or download by default, embedding optional. Default model Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B Q4_K_M. |
| Plan 1 | libc: a curated table plus `extern`/`link` now; libclang header import later. |
| Plan 1 | Keep the HTTP endpoint backend as an option. |
| Plan 1 | `/` is real division; `(div a b)` is integer division. |
| Plan 2 | The detail pass writes into the **source file itself**, under the author's words (not a separate file). Authors may edit the steps. |
| Plan 2 | Failures after all repair attempts get a model explanation; raw errors only with `--verbose`. |
| Follow-up | Steps never outlive their sentence: remove leftovers, revise on a sentence change, review edited steps. |
